Explanation of StringProcessing code.
1.First of all i used public static boolean strong(String password), so that
the compiler will be able to indentify the strong password from invalid one.
That's why i used some variables so that in the code there will be Uppercase,
Lowcase letters, digit and one special sign. Moreover the password must be
at least 8, so in the code i used this method if(password.length()<8)return 
false;. And by method for(char c:password.toCharArray())-i include uppercase,
lowcase, digit and special sign.
2.Then i used the same method but there i used to count digit and words in
a line, for example i used int cntdigit=0; and wordslength().
3.Conclusion: i used Scanner... checked is password strong and ouput the 
amount of digits and words.
