In 5 static methods i begin the code with java.util.*;(it's a librery which 
includes all librery in java, i used to use it because it short to write and 
i needed to use Scanner (System.in).
Then in every code i used public static int().
and i ended all codes with s.o.p(...(n))
In non static i didn't use static and used an ordinary method of solving this 
problems moreover i used ArrayList<Integer>listNumbers<>()-It helps me
to input any amount of numbers, because in this problems i needed to input
some numbers to find out the answer.
The differenct between static and non static is that in static the output is the
name of class method but in non static i needed to use some formulas like
for(number:listNumbers) or include another names of functions.
Conclusion: static method much easier.
